# Password-Generator

This is the Password Generator project I worked on during the bootcamp. 

I used a variety of javascript code / syntax to complete the task at hand. 

This was a very difficult challenge and I needed to reach out to multiple people for help.

Generating this password requires the user to follow prompts for how to set up the password conditionals of using upper and/or lower case alphabet, numbers, and/or special characters. 

This was done all in javascript - I attempted to use the concat() method to arrange all the variables when all the conditional requirments were enabled, but could not tie in that to be only used when all confirmations were set.
